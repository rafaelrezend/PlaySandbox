Play Sandbox
=====================================
Testing Play framework and its potential for future personal projects.



Versions:
---------

v0.2
  H2 database replaced by MongoDB NoSQL, using Jackson.
  Similar to https://github.com/Mironor/Play-2.0-Java-MongoDb-Jackson-exemple.
  Deployment to Heroku not tested, because the existing MongoDB modules require credit card, though they have free options.

v0.1
  Initial commit.
  Todo List example provided by Play Framework using H2 database:
